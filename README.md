MyCloud
=======

**Seamless cloud aggregation and data sharing platform**

Imagine having a single place where you can add, remove, edit and share all files on Google Drive, DropBox, Box etc. without having to worry about where your files get stored. Even better, having a mountable filesystem which mirrors this aggregated cloud storage on your local machine. That is exactly what this project "MyCloud" addresses. 

This project was done as part of the HackTech 2014 36-hour hackathon held at Santa Monica. 

The project is right now not complete. It has a Web interface which allows listing, deleting and sharing the files. It has content based search across all files on your cloud storages. Also, it does a media aggregation so that you get to see all your videos and audios in a single place irrespective of where you stored it on the cloud.
We also have a partially working filesystem implementation based on FUSE.
